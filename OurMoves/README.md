# What is this?
If you download this repo, and use these images whe prompted during the programs runtime,
you should get the same outputs to the images in the ImageStepOutputs folder, and the AI should move
the same as shown in the AiMoves folder.

Just rename game0 to game, then game1 to game etc...
