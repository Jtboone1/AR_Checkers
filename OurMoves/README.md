# What is this?

If you want to try this program, simply download the OurMoves folder along with main.py and checkers.py

Run ` python checkers.py ` in the directory above ` OurMoves `.
Then when the game prompts for a move, simply enter the correct move. In the case
of our moves, they are ordered numerically. Illegal moves may crash the program.

Have fun!
