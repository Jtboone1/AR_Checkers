# Requirements
Opencv
Numpy

# How to run
The user moves first.

1. Run ` python checkers.py `.
2. Move your piece, take a picture, and save it in the same directory as ` game.jpg `. Press any button to continue.
3. A series of images will popup. Press any button on the images to continue.
4. The AI will display it's move on screen. Move the piece to where the AI wants. Press any button on the image to continue.
5. Go to step 2

If you don't have the exact checkerboard and the exact camera, this setup doesn't exactly work (Ha). <br/>
I have therefor saved a series of Step 2s game.jpgs in a folder so someone else who wants to see this program
in action can still do some things!

### Small Note
The Algorithm that was used in this project was not made by us, and can be found here: 
https://github.com/ivanmrsulja/checkers-bot

This project was mainly for the purpose of learning about Image Processing, and not AI.
We decided to just borrow an AI just to see if our Image Processing techniques work.

We did however need to tweak this program in order to take in the output to our Image Processing
program, instead of what it originally did, which was take in checker moves from the command line.
